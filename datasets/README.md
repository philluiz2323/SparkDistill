# `datasets/`

The in-repo registry of every verified SparkProof dataset that was merged — the
dataset-track counterpart of `runs/` (which records proof-of-training runs).

## How a dataset gets in here (miner flow)

1. Run SparkProof on a Blackwell CC VM and pass the release gate
   (`sparkproof-publish-dataset` refuses to publish otherwise).
2. Publish to Hugging Face. The publisher uploads the dataset rows **and** the proof
   artifacts under `proof/` in the same HF repo (`manifest.json`,
   `dataset_manifest.json`, `gpu_attestation.json`, `trajectories.jsonl`, ...).
3. Open a **text-only PR** against this repo that appends one JSON line to
   `datasets/registry.jsonl`. In the PR template, check
   **Dataset track submission**. Dataset PRs may not modify any other file:

```json
{"miner": "<github-handle>", "hf_url": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/<user>/<repo>", "trajectories_sha256": "<from dataset_manifest.json>", "rows_total": 128, "dataset_version": "triton-distill-v0.2"}
```

No dataset files are committed here — the PR is the link plus the hash that pins the
exact gated rows.

## What the validator does

Registry PRs are gated automatically by `.github/workflows/dataset_registry.yml`.
The workflow reads the dataset-track checkbox, rejects changes outside
`datasets/registry.jsonl`, verifies the proof, replaces any stale `dataset:*` label with
the computed result, and merges only submissions that reach `dataset:s` or above.
Rejected PRs are labeled `dataset:REJECT` and closed automatically. Failed
or sub-threshold PRs remain open.

The gate runs `eval.registry_gate`, which for each appended registry line:

1. Validates JSON schema and rejects duplicate `hf_url` / `trajectories_sha256`.
2. Downloads `proof/` from Hugging Face.
3. Runs `eval.dataset_verify` with a pinned SparkProof checkout.

`dataset_verify` checks, in order: required proof artifacts (including
`trajectories_raw.jsonl`, `validation_report.jsonl`, `novelty_report.json`);
GPU CC attestation passed with a content-bound nonce; release gate passed and rows
still match the gated sha256; and full production `sparkproof-verify` (pinned
generator, Fable 5 / GPT 5.6 Sol at `xhigh`, raw→verified consistency, merkle,
attestation nonce). Any failure is `dataset:REJECT` and the PR is not merged.

Manual re-check:

```bash
python -m eval.dataset_verify --hf-repo <user>/<repo> \
    --claimed-sha256 <trajectories_sha256 from the PR> \
    --sparkproof-root ../SparkProof --out eval/results/dataset_report.json
```

| label | verified rows |
|---|---|
| `dataset:l` | >= 10000 |
| `dataset:m` | >= 1000 |
| `dataset:s` | >= 100 |
| `dataset:none` | < 100 (proof may be valid, but not merged/rewarded) |
| `dataset:REJECT` | attestation, release-gate, hash, or policy failure |

Merged datasets become fair game for the training track: any training miner may cite a
registry entry's `hf_url` as the dataset behind a proof-of-training PR.

- **`registry.jsonl`** — append-only, one line per merged dataset PR. Never edited or
  reordered; corrections are appended, not rewritten (same convention as
  `runs/ledger.jsonl`).

## Verified smoke test (2026-07-11)

End-to-end run on a Blackwell RTX PRO 6000 CC VM (`ssh -p 20004 ubuntu@<host>`):

```bash
# SparkProof on the CC VM (sibling SparkDistill required for decontamination + SFT)
cd SparkProof
# .env: YUNWU_API_KEY or OPENROUTER_API_KEY, HF_TOKEN (org write access)
# SparkDistill/tritonbench must exist (gitignored — rsync or clone beside SparkProof)

scripts/run_triton_pipeline.sh \
  --run-id triton-cc-hf-001 \
  --limit 2 \
  --release-gate \
  --publish gittensor-model-hub/sparkproof-triton-v0
```

**Published:** [gittensor-model-hub/sparkproof-triton-v0](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gittensor-model-hub/sparkproof-triton-v0)

| check | result |
|---|---|
| rows published | 2 (both silver tier) |
| duplicate prompts / task_ids / responses | none — `api_tl_tensor`, `api_tl_tensor_descriptor` |
| release gate | `passed: true`, `blocked_rows: 0` |
| `trajectories_sha256` | `a746fa812fb098737cded713daf0f58b8ff59e485c9bdf8fd94f6b5cc1d5c846` |
| `proof/` artifacts on HF | yes (`manifest.json`, `dataset_manifest.json`, `gpu_attestation.json`, `trajectories.jsonl`, ...) |

**Validator re-check** (any machine with SparkProof + SparkDistill checkouts):

```bash
cd SparkDistill
python -m eval.dataset_verify \
  --hf-repo gittensor-model-hub/sparkproof-triton-v0 \
  --claimed-sha256 a746fa812fb098737cded713daf0f58b8ff59e485c9bdf8fd94f6b5cc1d5c846 \
  --sparkproof-root ../SparkProof \
  --out eval/results/dataset_report.json
# → verified=true, label=dataset:none (2 rows < 100 reward threshold)
```

**CC VM gotchas observed during the smoke test:**

- SSH port can change when the VM is reprovisioned (e.g. `20004` not `20002`).
- `SparkDistill/tritonbench/` is gitignored — decontamination and the release gate fail
  without it (`decontamination requires a TritonBench problem corpus`). Sync from a dev
  machine: `rsync -az SparkDistill/tritonbench/ ubuntu@<host>:~/SparkDistill/tritonbench/`.
- `HF_TOKEN` must be in SparkProof `.env` with write access to the target org/repo.
